# Linear_Regression_Bike_Sharing

## Project Overview
BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, has experienced a significant decline in revenue due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To sustain and accelerate revenue post-lockdown, the company aims to understand the demand for shared bikes. This project involves modeling the demand for shared bikes using available data to help BoomBikes prepare for future demand and optimize their business strategy.

## Business Goal
The objective is to develop a model to predict the demand for shared bikes based on various factors. The model will help BoomBikes understand how demand varies with different features, allowing them to adjust their business strategy accordingly.

## Data Description
The dataset contains daily bike demand data with several independent variables for two years from 2018 to 2019.
